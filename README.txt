Simplified procedure for annual update:

- update confidential data from SIOFA (see Confidential data.txt within Data folder)
- update CCAMLR data (CCAMLR_2023 files in Data folder, need to ask CCAMLR Secretariat to receive HIMI area estimates 
			OR download directly from CCAMLR website on available data and calculate HIMI area)
- switch between "dist" and "hooks" in the Main.R script (around line 78) to get both estimates
- get the outputs (Output folder, each file includes the data of the last run)
- insert outputs in a document for SC
